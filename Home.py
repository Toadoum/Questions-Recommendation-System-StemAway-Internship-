    What is Discourse?
    Discourse is the 100% open source discussion platform built for the next decade of the Internet. Use it as a\
    mailing list, discussion forum, long-form chat room, and more!\
    Discourse is a from-scratch reboot, an attempt to reimagine what a modern Internet discussion forum should be today,\
    in a world of ubiquitous smartphones, tablets, Facebook, and Twitter.
    Discourse's trust system means that the community builds a natural immune system to defend itself from trolls, bad actors,\
    and spammers â€” and the most engaged forum members can assist in the governance of their community. They put a trash can on\
    every street corner with a simple, low-friction flagging system. Positive behaviors are encouraged through likes and badges. \
    They gently, constantly educate members in a just-in-time manner on the universal rules of civilized discourse.
    
    The main problem is that Discourse plateform have not yet an efficient recommender system to help avoiding duplicate questions.\
    A recommender system that can recommend to a user when asking a question a similare question already answered will help people\
    trying to give answer to the same problem again and again without knowing. 
    
    Steps to be followed for a defined workflow :

    - Use stack overflow and Quora dataset for prototyping. \

    - Perform a web srapping on discourse plateform to validate our prototype.\

    - Build the final product as a pluging to add within discourse plateform.\
